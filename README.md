# Maya AI

An intelligent voice assistant designed to reduce administrative burden through natural language interactions.

## Overview

Maya AI helps entrepreneurs and startup founders focus on what matters by handling administrative tasks, providing budgeting guidance, and offering business insights through conversational AI. By automating routine interactions, Maya AI frees up valuable time for innovation and growth.

## Vision

Born from the understanding that self-starters often get bogged down in administrative details, Maya AI aims to reduce complexity rather than add to it. We're creating technology that works alongside founders to enhance their efficiency and decision-making capabilities.

## Technology Foundation

- **Python & Flask**: Core application framework
- **OpenAI API**: Natural language understanding and generation
- **Twilio Integration**: SMS communication channel
- **Memory System**: Contextual conversation tracking
- **TensorFlow**: Exploration for neural network training

## Core Capabilities

- **Administrative Task Automation**: Handles routine business queries and tasks
- **Budgeting Intelligence**: Provides financial insights and budgeting guidance
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers context from previous conversations
- **SMS Accessibility**: Available via text message for on-the-go support

## Implementation

The system utilizes a simple yet effective architecture:

```
Founder → SMS → Maya AI → OpenAI → Business Logic → Response
```

## Development

This repository demonstrates the SMS interaction functionality with potential for expansion to voice interfaces and additional business service integrations.

### Setup Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API credentials
